# Customer Segmentation Using Clustering

This project leverages clustering algorithms for customer segmentation, a vital aspect of business analytics and marketing. By segmenting customers into distinct groups based on their behavior or characteristics, businesses can make data-driven decisions to improve customer experiences and optimize marketing strategies.

## Features

- **Clustering Algorithms Implemented:**
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Hierarchical Clustering
  - DBSCAN
- **Data Preprocessing:** Handles data cleaning, normalization, and transformation.
- **Visualizations:** Generate meaningful visualizations, including cluster distribution and scatter plots.
- **Actionable Insights:** Provides insights into customer groups to aid in decision-making.

---

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language:** Python (100% of the codebase)
- **Key Libraries:**
  - NumPy
  - Pandas
  - Matplotlib
  - Seaborn
  - Scikit-learn
